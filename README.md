A modern boilerplate for building full-stack applications with Next.js and a cloud-first approach.

## Why I Created This

Starting a new project often involves setting up the same stack repeatedly. **NexGen** simplifies this process by providing a pre-configured setup for developing scalable, full-stack web applications.

> **Note**: This template is not designed to be a highly customizable solution that allows you to choose from a variety of technologies. Such approaches often result in unpolished code attempting to integrate multiple options. Instead, NexGen offers a ready-to-use stack of carefully selected technologies that are precisely integrated with one another. The template is continuously updated to stay in sync with evolving technology trends.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js (Canary)**: The core framework for building the app.
- **Vercel**: For seamless deployment and hosting.
- **Supabase**: Backend as a service for database and authentication.
- **DrizzleORM**: A lightweight, type-safe ORM for database operations.
- **ShadCN/UI**: For building beautiful and reusable UI components.

## Example Application: Todo App

To showcase the capabilities of this boilerplate, Iâ€™ve built a simple **Todo App**. This demonstrates the integration of all the technologies in a practical use case.

### Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup using Supabase Auth.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete using DrizzleORM and Supabase.
- **Responsive Design**: A clean and modern UI built with ShadCN/UI.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Tasks are dynamically fetched and rendered using Next.js.
- **Deployment Ready**: Optimized for deployment on Vercel.
